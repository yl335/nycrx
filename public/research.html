					<h4><abbr title="School Based Health Center">SBHC</abbr> Reproductive Health Project</h4>
					<p>Using 340B to help to reduce teenage pregnancy in NYC.</p>
					<p>NYCRx has partnered with <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/home/home.shtml">NYC Department of Health</a>, <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/default.htm">NYC Department of Education</a> and <a href="http://fphny.org/">Fund for Public Health in New York</a>, with support from an anonymous donor, to provide free contraceptives at <a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/ourstories/schoolhealthcenters/">school-based health centers (SBHC)</a> in NYC. We helped each 340B eligible SBHCs implement the 340B program so that they could purchase contraceptives at deeply discounted prices, and save the anonymous donor a significant amount of money. </p> 
					<p>The program was supposed to last 3 years program. Fortunately, due to NYCRx’s <b>leveraging of the power of the 340B program</b>, the donor was able to stretch the funding to 5 years. Year 5 has just begun and <b>NYCRx has saved ____ to date</b>.</p>
					<p>Our hope is that by having access to safe contraceptives, teens can <b>avoid unwanted pregnancies</b>, focus on their education and build a solid foundation for their futures.</p>

					<h4>Differential Drug Pricing in NYC</h4>
					<p> Determining if prescription access is affected by location and neighborhood factors.</p>
					<p>In partnership with <a href="http://www.downstate.edu/publichealth/">SUNY Downstate School of Public Health</a>, NYCRx has investigated how drug pricing and availability change from location to location through the five boroughs of NYC.</p>
					<p>The main research questions are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Does drug pricing correlate with neighborhood income? </li>
						<li>Do certain neighborhoods have greater or lesser access to affordable medication?</li>
					</ul>
					<p>This project may shed light on <b>how drug pricing is influenced</b> by an area's socioeconomic, political and geographical environment and thus add a new dimension to improving access to affordable medications for people who need it the most.</p>
					<p>In 2011, we helped <a href="http://www.downstate.edu/publichealth/">SUNY Downstate School of Public Health</a> with the research methodology, study design and data collection. The report on the findings is nearing final draft form. </p>

					<h4>Medication Adherence in Patients with Type II Diabetes</h4>
					<p>Studying methods to improve medication adherence in patients with Type II Diabetes.</p>
					<p>In partnership with <a href="http://www.pharmacy.touro.edu/">Touro College of Pharmacy</a>, NYCRx is working with an inter-professional team to research and improve medication adherence in patients with type II diabetes in Central Harlem communities.</p>
					<p>Central Harlem has one of the <b>highest rates of type II diabetes</b> across the five boroughs, and thus improving medication adherence will significantly improve the health of a large portion of people living in Central Harlem.</p>
					<p>In 2011, we did the literature review, put together the study design, and compiled a well-rounded research team. In 2012, we hope to secure funding for this project, run the study at a Central Harlem-based clinic, report on the findings and recommend interventions to improve medication adherence.</p>
					<p>Our belief is that taking medication in a consistent and timely manner, along with a healthy lifestyle, can <b>improve the welfare of patients</b> with type II diabetes while managing healthcare costs.</p>

					<h4>New York State Medicaid “Carve-in” Study</h4>
					<p>Understanding the impact of Medicaid Managed Care inclusion in 340B at clinic level.</p>
					<p>Historically, <a href="http://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/">New York State Medicaid</a> has not allowed prescriptions to be included in the 340B program. However, in October 2011, NY State Medicaid allowed eligible clinics to optionally include <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447221/">Medicaid Managed Care</a> prescriptions into the 340B program (“the carve-in”). While other states have also enacted carve-ins, <b>no study to date</b> has highlighted the impact of a carve-in at the clinic level.</p>
					<p>The purpose of this project – conducted in partnership with <a href="http://wagner.nyu.edu/">New York University’s Robert F. Wagner School of Public Service</a> – is to report on the impact of the carve-in by using pre and post carve-in data from select participating clinics in NYC.</p>
